## Project

Use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to write a small single page web application with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). 

### Requirements

* Has a single button in the center called "Current Weather.
* Upon click, it uses the built-in browser [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the user's location
* The application then grabs the current weather for that location from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current) and displays it on the page

Styling is not the primary goal here, but it's not a large UI so try to make it look decent. We're primarily looking at your ability to write clean organized code, interact with external APIs, and handle asynchronous JavaScript. Your commit history should clearly show your progression through the application.
