# LoadUp Engineering Coding Challenge

Welcome to the LoadUp coding test! This test assignment serves a few purposes.
It let's you show-off your technical knowledge, your stylistic sensibilities, and
your ability to wrangle with an existing codebase. On top of that, it also gives you
a fun opportunity to hack on a new feature!

A few things to keep in mind before you begin:

- While this repo is a Rails app, it on an older version than the LoadUp production
  app (which is kept quite up-to-date). This is in part because this repository is
  forked from a [RealWorldApp](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) standard repo.
  This also means that, if Rails isn't something you know super well, you can complete
  this challenge by using on of the other backend repos (Java Spring, Node Express,
  Laravel, Elixir Phoenix, etc). We do recommend that you do use the Rails version if
  you know Rails already, but don't feel trapped if you Node/Java/whatever that much
  better.

- Next, treat this assignment as if you are already on the job and adding this feature
  to a production app, whatever that means to you. This should reflect the kind of work,
  processes, and the level-of-quality that you would plan on delivering at LoadUp.

- Lastly, have fun with it! If you have good ideas for improving the feature beyond
  this description, go for it!

Happy Hacking!
